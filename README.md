# Drupal 8 Site template

This repository contains the code to spin up some Docker containers from docker-compose and the Drupal code managed via composer as a template for website development.

## Required
1. Docker [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
1. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Good to have
1. Composer
1. Drush

## Steps

1. Clone this repository.
1. Run `make build`
1. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

To rebuild (clearing out all existing data), run: `make rebuild`

**Note:** a full list of commands available can be found by running `make help`

## Usage

* Composer file is in the root but the web server should point to `/web` subfolder.
* Start the machine (after build from the "Steps" section) `make start`
* Stop the machine `make stop`
* Help for more make commands `make help`

## Development

* Get a mysql command prompt `make mysql`
* Open a terminal on the web server container `make webshell`
* Open a terminal on the database server container `make dbshell`
* require new Drupal modules `make composer arg="require drupal/devel:~1.0"`

You can also run commands using docker. e.g.

* Run a drush command `docker-compose exec web drush status`
* Run any composer included module e.g. Drupal Console: `docker-compose exec web drupal --help`

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold)
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess),
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your core files.

1. Run `composer update drupal/core webflo/drupal-core-require-dev symfony/* --with-dependencies` to update Drupal Core and its dependencies.
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed.
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.
1. In the event that there are non-trivial conflicts in step 2, you may wish
   to perform these steps on a branch, and use `git merge` to combine the
   updated core files with your customized files. This facilitates the use
   of a [three-way merge tool such as kdiff3](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-setup-kdiff-as-diff-tool-for-git.html). This setup is not necessary if your changes are simple;
   keeping all of your modifications at the beginning or end of the file is a
   good strategy to keep merges easy.

## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@composer drupal:scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
### How do I switch from packagist.drupal-composer.org to packages.drupal.org?

Follow the instructions in the [documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg).
